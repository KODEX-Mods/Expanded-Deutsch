 #BAP innovations
 innovation_nubianization: "Nubianization"
 innovation_nubianization_desc: "During the 11th-century the kingdoms of Nubia went through a process of Nubianization, like the Kushites before them the Nubians adeptly absorbed and adapted foreign influences, synthesizing these influences with their own culture to create new unique forms of language, titular, and religion. One of the main initiators of this process of active Nubianization of courtly life has been suggested to have been Georgios, the archbishop of Dongola and hence the head of the Makurian church. He seems to have popularized the Nubian language as the written language to replace Nubian Greek, and counter the growing influence of Arabic in the Coptic Church of Egypt. Also introduced were more indigenous influences on the church such as the cult of dead rulers and bishops, as well as indigenous Nubian saints."
