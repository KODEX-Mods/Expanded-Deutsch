It contained forty clauses that touched on all possible topics of contemporary legal concern: private property, public property, the church, civil law, royal finances, and the military. The work was advanced for its day, deriving its precepts not only from Norman and French, but also Muslim and Byzantine (especially Justinian) legal theories."

On the reverse, Roger II is depicted in the style of a Byzantine emperor and his eldest son, Duke Roger III of Apulia, is depicted in battle dress. The coin, called Ducat, took its common name from the Duchy of Apulia, which the younger Roger had been given by his father.

Throughout its history, the region has come under control of various empires, including the Achaemenid, Neo-Assyrian Empire, Parthian, Roman, Sassanian, Byzantine, Umayyad, Abbassid, Mongol, and Ottoman Empires, all of which introduced their own faiths and cultures. Due to this constant presence of outside forces, never has Transcaucasia been unified into a single state - but this does not have to remain the truth. If a great ruler could emerge and prove themselves capable of standing amongst the powers that surrond us, Transcaucasia could be recognized as a true and independent state."
