 game_concept_briton: "Briton"
 game_concept_romano_briton_desc: "The Romano-Britons, or simply Britons, were the varyingly Romanized [oldbrit|E] who inhabited Britannia until the 5th century AD when the province gradually fell into a military anarchy due to Pictish, Irish and Saxon [raids|E].\n\nWhen Rome finally gave up Britain around the year 440 AD, opportunistic British warlords established their own [kingdoms|E] utilizing Germanic [mercenaries|E] who often tended to usurp leadership for themselves. \nIn some cases however, the ruling elite seems to have maintained itself and simply got assimilated by their retinues over the centuries.\n\nBy the 7th century, the Britons have either been culturally assimilated into new [anglosaxon|E] groups, or have gradually evolved into the various Brythonic peoples."

 game_concept_old_briton: "Pritanīans"
 game_concept_old_briton_desc: "The Pritanīans were the original inhabitants of the island of Britain prior to the Roman conquest. \n\nAfter Claudius’ Invasion, the island was gradually integrated into the wider Roman world, leading to the steady Romanization of the Pritanīans within the province while those beyond the walls to the north would eventually evolve into the ancestors of the Picts. \n\nWhile the original Pritanīans are long gone, their language, as well as aspects of their culture, survive in the later [romanobrit|E] and Pictish traditions."

 game_concept_anglo_saxon_desc: "The Anglo-Saxons were a collection of Ænglisċ speaking peoples that inhabited Britain since the Sub-Roman Period from 5th century onward. \n\nDescending from the assimilated [romano_briton|E] and various Germanic [mercenaries|E] groups, they were never a truly unified force. However, due to the efforts of writers like Bede, the ænglisc speaking inhabitants of the many Germanic [kingdoms|E] would gradually develop a common Angelcynn identity that distinguished itself from the Franks on the mainland and Brittonic speaking [romano_briton|E] of Wales and Cornwall."

 game_concept_east_slavs_desc: "The East Slavs, also known as the Rus or Ruthenians, are the descendants of the [old_slavs|E] who migrated east from their ancestral homeland of Podlasia.\n\nSettling in the Pontic Steppe and the formerly Baltic and Finno-Ugric lands to the north, these East Slavs would gradually fall under the influence of North Germanic, Varangian raiders, as well as under Byzantine influence that gradually spread northwards from the Black Sea. By the 9th century, the Eastern Slavs were divided into various tribes who were varyingly influenced by their many neighbours before the eventual rise of the Kievan Rus.\n\nCharacterized by Byzantine and North Germanic influenced [culture|E] and their East Slavic [heritage|E], the East Slavs form the link between the [west_slavs|E] and [south_slavs|E]."

 game_concept_west_slavs_desc: "The West Slavs, colloquially also known as the Wends or Lechites, are the descendants of the [old_slavs|E] who migrated west into the formerly Germanic lands of the Lugians, Gothones and Warini.\n\nSettling along the Vistula, Oder and Elbe rivers, the various West Slavic tribes would gradually repopulate these lands after the departure of its previous inhabitants while simultaneously assimilating the few groups who stayed behind. By the 9th century, most of these Lechitic tribes have established themselves in the western section of the Northern European Plain and became ever more entangled with the Frankish and Bulgarian states that surrounded them which contributed to the rise of native principalities such as Moravia or Poland.\n\nCharacterized by their Frankish influenced [culture|E] and their West Slavic [heritage|E], the West Slavs form the northern link between the [east_slavs|E] and [pannonian_slavs|E]."

 game_concept_old_slavs_desc: "The Slavs are the ancestors of the many Slavic peoples that came to inhabit much of Eastern Europe starting in the 6th century AD.\n\nWhile the exact origin and ethnogenesis of the Slavs remains a mystery even to the present day, a likely homeland for these Old Slavs rests within the Podlasia region between Ukraine and Belarus from where these Slavs would start to migrate East, South and West into Ruthenia, Poland, Eastern Germany, Pannonia and the Balkans. While it is most likely that many Slavic peoples can trace their origin to pre-existing peoples that would come to be assimilated because of these Slavic migrations, they nevertheless considered themselves, and were considered by their neighbours, to, more or less, constitute a single people even up until the early modern period.\n\nIn the game, the Slavs are the ancestral culture of the various East, West and South and Pannonian Slavic peoples."

 game_concept_egyptians_desc: "The Egyptians were the ancient inhabitants of the Nile Valley stretching from Aswad all the way to the Nile Delta. Though they have never disappeared, the Egyptians have undergone multiple stages of development since the first dynasties arose in the 4th millennium BCE.\n\nThe conquest of Egypt by Alexander the Great has opened the way for the gradual Hellenization of the native Egyptians who adopted the Greek alphabet for their own language while also converting to Christianity starting in the 1st century CE while under Roman rule, gradually evolving into the early Copts. In most recent history, Egypt fell under the control of the Islamic Caliphates, marking the beginning of the gradual Arabization and Islamization of the local Coptic populace. \n\nCharacterized by their Egyptian [heritage|E] and Coptic [language|E], the descendants of the ancient Egyptians continue to inhabit the lands along the Nile despite the gradual linguistic and religious shift that has been occurring since the 7th century CE."

Styling itself as a restored Achaemenid Empire, even coming close to re-establishing the historical boundaries during final the Sassanid-Byzantine war, the Sassanid Empire was eventually left weakened after decades of war and thus became an easy target for the early Islamic Caliphate.\n\nIn the aftermath of the Islamic Conquest of Iran, the many peoples of the former empire began to slowly convert to the new religion, giving rise to new native Iranian dynasties such as the Saffarids or Samanids during the Iranian Intermezzo. Apart from being the main force behind the integration of Khwarazm and Sogdiana into the Ērānian sphere, these dynasties were also patrons of the culture and arts that gave rise to the Islamic-Persian cultural fusion.\n\nCharacterized by their Iranian [heritage|E] and various Iranian [languages|E] such as Persian, Khwarazmian or Caspian, the many descendants of the Ērānians still form the dominant group on the Iranian plateau and in Central Asia."

 game_concept_germans_desc: "The Germans are the descendants of various old Germanic tribes that inhabited the eastern territories of Francia such as the Rhineland, Saxony or Franconia.\n\nWhile originally divided between their tribal components such as the Franks, Saxons, Alemannics and Bavarians, these tribes shared a series of similar Germanic dialects that separated them from the gradually romanised Franks to the west. This shared Diutsc language would then go on to form the basis for a shared identity that made these central Europeans different from their Romance and Slavic neighbours, although it wouldn’t be until the modern period that a true sense of a shared national identity would emerge. Nevertheless, these central European Diutsc speakers would still, in spite of changing and evolving tribal identities that usually served as an umbrella term for this group, become known as a more or less single coherent people and play a crucial role in European dynastic and political history for centuries to come.\n\nCharacterized by their Frankish influenced [culture|E] and their Central Germanic [heritage|E], the Germans exist primarily within Central Europe in the territories that made up East Francia."

Over the course of a mere century, the Arabs had managed to assert their rule over lands as far west as Hispania and as far east as Khorasan. With the spread of the new religion, the Arabic language and culture, reinforced by migration and assimilation, began to spread and diverge across the vast Islamic Empires, eventually giving rise to various new cultures in the process.\n\nCharacterized by their Arabic [language|E] and their Arabic [heritage|E], the Arabs exist primarily within the Arabian Peninsula but can also be found in substantial numbers in Mesopotamia, the Levante and the Maghreb."

Following a series of conflicts between the Romans and Huns, and amidst various Roman Civil Wars, the Goths established their own kingdoms in Gaul, later Iberia, and Italy. While the Goths assimilated into wider Roman culture for the most part, they nevertheless left their mark on the mediterranean landscape for centuries, especially so in Iberia and Southern France where Visigothic Laws persisted way into the 10th century CE and beyond.\n\nCharacterized by their East Germanic [language|E] and their East Germanic [heritage|E], the Goths have long been assimilated and can now only be found in Crimea."

While most of them were conquered and assimilated in time, the old Callaeci, Astures and Cantabri managed to resist the Romans until the Augustan era, only being subjugated around the late 1st century BCE. Despite this however, they managed to preserve their language and culture way into the early medieval period during which they would briefly reassert their independence.\n\nThough they would finally be conquered and [romanized|E] for good by the Visigoths, they would still play a vital role in the future of Iberia: After the Muslim Conquest of the peninsula, parts of the Visigothic nobility would flee to the mountainous regions where they would ally with the locals to form the Kingdom of Asturias, the predecessor to later kingdoms such as León, Castile and Galicia."

Over the course of Rome's history, the label came to denote more so a cultural lifestyle and legal status, rather than an actual ethnic identity, though more often than not it did take on such a form as well.\n\nCharacterized by their Greek or Latin derived [languages|E], as well as their Latin, Frankish, Iberian, Vlach, Rhaetic or (Eastern) Roman [heritages|E], the descendants of the Romans continue to constitute the majority population across much of the mediterranean."
