 balkan_flavour.0001.t: "The Lands of Slavonia"
 balkan_flavour.0001.desc: "Faced with a potential threat from the Magyars, the Principality of Savia is slowly transforming into a mere frontier region."
 balkan_flavour.0001.a: "Interesting."
 
 balkan_flavour.0003.t: "The Arrival of the Magyars"
 balkan_flavour.0003.desc: "In an unexpected turn of events, after crushing any opposition to their migration, the Magyars have managed to cross the carpathian mountains and have taken control of the eastern basin. Much of the land they have conquered thus far has been put the torch and the inhabitants have either fled or have been enslaved by these newcomers. \n\nIt is only a matter of time before these Magyars will attempt to expand their gains at our expense."
 balkan_flavour.0003.a: "We will weather this storm!"

 balkan_flavour.0004.t: "Whispers of an Ancient Town"
 balkan_flavour.0004.desc: "While my scouts were traversing the lands of Pannonia, they’ve come across the fortified town of Castei who’s inhabitants speak in a strange tongue that is unintelligible to that of the surrounding villages and informed my steward about it. \n\nCuriously enough, the townsfolk appear to differ not just in their speech but in their lifestyle too as they seem to be most talented artisans, crafting unique artifacts of all kinds, unseen in the rest of Pannonia. \nLikewise, their town is unlike many others of the area as it boasts respectable stone fortifications and a unique architecture reminiscent of long bygone times.\n\nWhile there, my scouts were approached by a local who wishes for an audience with me."
 balkan_flavour.0004.a: "Allow them an audience. I wish to hear their story."
 balkan_flavour.0004.b: "I don't have time for this."
 
 balkan_flavour.0005.t: "The Pannonian"
 balkan_flavour.0005.desc: "A man steps before me and introduces himself: \n\n'Salutio, dominu. \n\nMy name is [ce_pannonian_romance_guest_spawn.GetTitledFirstName] and I humbly thank you for allowing this audience. We [ce_pannonian_romance_guest_spawn.GetCulture.GetNameNoTooltip]s have lived within these lands among the Avars and Slavs for countless generations. But as of late, our towns have become few and our fields have become barren. I fear our [ce_pannonian_romance_guest_spawn.GetCulture.GetName] customs and [ce_pannonian_romance_guest_spawn.GetCulture.GetLanguage.GetName] tongue will soon be lost to the ages. \n\nPerhaps you would listen to our tales and allow us to mingle here at court so others may hear the story of old Pannonia?'"
 balkan_flavour.0005.a: "Please, teach me about your people!"
 balkan_flavour.0005.b: "I understand your concerns, you may stay here as a guest."
 balkan_flavour.0005.c: "This isn't of my concern."
 
 #British Flavour Events
 
 british_flavour.0001.t: "The Sacking of Alt Clut"
 british_flavour.0001.desc: "I scramble whatever belongings I can carry before making a run for the gate. The surrounding countryside has already been plundered and much of the land has been put to the torch. It would take a while before we get to the temporary holding of Gwovan upstream of the river. While on this journey, I reflect on what had happened. \n\nThe Fortress of [GetTitleByKey('c_lennox').GetNameNoTier] has finally been sacked. Those who didn’t manage to escape the siege have either been killed or captured by the invaders. I can only imagine the horror of those who didn’t make it. \n\n As we arrive at Gwovan, it becomes increasingly clear that we won’t return to [GetTitleByKey('b_dumbarton').GetNameNoTier] in the foreseeable future. The old castle is merely a ruin now and easy picking for any outside invaders. We will have to make do with what we have left, and as such, the Kingdom of [GetTitleByKey('d_galloway').GetNameNoTier], the final bastion of the Hen Ogledd, is no more. Instead, Strathclyde rises in its place, ready to defend the [ROOT.Char.GetCulture.GetCollectiveNoun] in the future."
 british_flavour.0001.a: "We will prevail!"
