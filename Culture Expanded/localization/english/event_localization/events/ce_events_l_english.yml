 british_culture.0002.t: "The Rise of the Anglecynn"
 british_culture.0002.desc: "After the fall of the Western Roman Empire, various Germanic tribes began to migrate to the British Isles, among them the Jutes, Angles and Saxons who would go on to form their own petty kingdoms across much of the land they settled. After a lengthy period of expansion against the native Britons and consolidation of surrounding tribes, Kingdoms like Kent, Mercia and Northumbria would gradually start to forge new regional cultures unique to the isle with their own dialects and identities. This would slowly change with the Viking invasion that saw fall of many of these old kingdoms in rapid succession with the rest gradually being absorbed into what would later become England. As such, a new culture has begun to emerge, one that is defined by the shared faith, origin and tongue of these native Germanics of Britain, that stands in a contrast to those from across the sea. At last, these people have started to see themselves no longer as Mercians, West Saxons or Kents, but as a common English people."
 british_culture.0002.a: "This will change the course of history."
 
 british_culture.0011.t: "The Divergence of Brythonic"
 british_culture.0011.desc: "Since the Fall of Caergloui to the Anglo-Saxons, the Britons of Britannia and Brittany have slowly but steadily diverged from one another. After centuries of relative isolation, two unique Brittonic varieties have emerged from the dialects of Dumnonia and Cambria respectively: while both continue to identify as Brythonic, the variety of each area has become largely unintelligible to the other."
 british_culture.0011.a: "Brythonwyr o hyd!"
 
 balkan_culture.0002.t: "A Bosnian People"
 balkan_culture.0002.desc: "When the Kingdom of Bosnia was established, not many could have imagined the renaissance it would bring; Independent from both Serbia and Croatia, the people of the Central Dinaric Alps and along the Bosna River have begun to see themselves as neither Serb nor Croat, but as a new and distinct Bosnian people with their own culture and heritage, both founded in our very kingdom. "
 balkan_culture.0002.a: "Živjela slobodna Bosna!"
 
 balkan_culture.0004.t: "The Illyrian People"
 balkan_culture.0004.desc: "When the Slavs first migrated into the Balkans in the 6th century, they consisted of many disparate tribes who were simply fleeing from the invading Avars. \n\nBut since we united the lands of Illyria, the tribes have grown quite accustomed to one another; poets and intellectuals from across the known world travel to the Illyrian court, contributing to an emerging Slavonic Renaissance. It is under the stability of my realm that the Illyrian people have finally developed a common identity that transcends the old tribal boundaries.\n\nThus, it is only fitting that we should foster this emerging sense of unity and develop it into something truly new and lasting."
 balkan_culture.0004.a: "Slava Iliriji!"
 
 balkan_culture.0005.t: "The Illyrian People"
 balkan_culture.0005.desc: "When the Slavs first migrated into the Balkans in the 6th century, they consisted of many disparate tribes who were simply fleeing from the invading Avars.\n\nBut since the formation of the Illyrian Kingdom, these tribes have grown ever closer to one another to the point that they now consider themselves a single people."
 balkan_culture.0005.a: "Good for them."
 
 balkan_culture.0006.t: "The Pannonian Lands"
 balkan_culture.0006.desc: "Many centuries ago, [GetTitleByKey('k_balaton').GetNameNoTier] was overrun by the vile hordes of the Huns who plundered and devastated the land. In the aftermath of their demise, the land was subsequently occupied by peoples such as the Goths, Lombards, Avars and lastly us [pannonian_founder.GetCulture.GetNameNoTooltip]s.  \n\nBut now, after countless centuries, I have managed to reunite these lands under a single banner. My authority stretches from the vital forts of [GetTitleByKey('b_sisak').GetNameNoTier] and [GetTitleByKey('b_vakovo').GetNameNoTier] on the river Sava to the ancient town of [GetTitleByKey('b_gyor').GetNameNoTier] on the river Danube. At last, Pannonia is whole once more. \n\nIt is time to forge a new destiny for these lands that shall echo through the centuries!"

 balkan_culture.0007.t: "The Rise of a new People"
 balkan_culture.0007.desc: "Faced with a constant outside threat from the Franks, Bulgars, Magyars and even fellow Slavs, the people of my realm have increasingly forged a new bond that has grown beyond the divisive tribal lines of old."

 ce_custom_kingdom_event.0001.t: "The Restoration of Illyria"
 ce_custom_kingdom_event.0001.desc: "Today we celebrate as the Illyrian Kingdom rises once more. Ever since its fall to the Roman Republic in the 2nd century BC, Illyria has remained under the yoke of foreign rule, changing hands between various Roman usurpers, Germanic invaders and finally Slavic chiefs and princes.\n\nBut at last, I have managed what not even Pleuratus could’ve dreamed of: I have united Illyria under a single crown, brought together its many tribes under a common banner. No longer shall this ancient land bow to foreign tyrants but prosper as a united realm under my benevolent rule!"

 rus_culture.0002.desc: "Many decades have passed since the Norse invaded the lands of the Eastern Slavs. But as time has passed, so have the Norse increasingly adopted the locals’ tongue and customs; simultaneously, the Norse have lent their knowledge in government and warfare to the Slavs they rule over, creating a new identity that transcends the old."
 rus_culture.0002.a: "We should embrace these changes within our realm!"
